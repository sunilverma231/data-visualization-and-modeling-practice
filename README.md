# Data Visualization and Modeling Practice

This repository contains hands-on exercises and projects focused on visual storytelling, geospatial analysis, and model development using Python. The work is structured around four key areas: visualization techniques, map creation, and basic model development using machine learning tools.

---

## 1. Creating Maps & Visualizing Geospatial Data
Explored how to create interactive maps using `Folium` to visualize geospatial data like location points, choropleths, and clustered markers. This helped in understanding geographic trends and region-based data patterns.

- Tools Used: Folium, GeoJSON, Python
- Key Learnings: Interactive mapping, geospatial plotting, and choropleth visualizations.

---

## 2. Area Plots, Histograms, and Bar Charts
Developed multiple visualizations including area plots, bar charts, and histograms to understand data distributions and categorical relationships.

- Tools Used: Matplotlib, Pandas
- Key Learnings: Plotting multiple columns, customizing plot styles, and combining visual types.

---

## 3. Model Development Review
Reviewed core concepts of model training and evaluation, including splitting datasets, fitting linear models, and measuring accuracy using metrics like MSE and RÂ² score.

- Tools Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
- Key Learnings: Simple linear regression pipeline, model validation, and performance interpretation.

---

## 4. Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Folium
Combined multiple Python visualization libraries to create meaningful, customized plots. Built scatter plots, regression plots, and geographic visualizations for storytelling and exploratory analysis.

- Tools Used: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- Key Learnings: Plot aesthetics, layered visualizations, regression plots, and map integration.
